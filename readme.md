# dwa15 - Project 3 - Developers' best friend
### Live URL
soon

### Description
This project is a excersise in the use and understanding of Laravel framework as
a tool for dynamic web application development. This particular application has
two 'pages' besides the landing page that each include a potentially useful tool
for creating filler data. The user genereator for instance can help a developer
create a data set for populating a database or testing validation (because, at
a single user's returned data is not all always coherent)

### Demo
soon

### Details for teaching team
I feel like laravel's documentation for newer versions is a little sub par and
I found myself spending alot of time reading solutions to problems that no longer
apply. However, it is very easy to find similar troubleshooting woes from earlier laravel
versions on the web and countless proposed solutions from the community. I feel like
by the time I got my application stable I didn't leave myself enough time to polish
the presentation of the pages and follow all of the better coding practices which I am not used to yet.

So, when you check out my code, I would greatly appreciate input on how my implementation
could have been better in regards to organizing the form logic (does anything look like a bad habit?)

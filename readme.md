### Description
This project is a excersise in the use and understanding of Laravel framework as
a tool for dynamic web application development. This particular application has
two 'pages' besides the landing page that each include a potentially useful tool
for creating filler data. The user genereator for instance can help a developer
create a data set for populating a database or testing validation (because, at
a single user's returned data is not all always coherent)
